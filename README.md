# Display drivers for μC PPU

This library provides backends for μC PPU to communicate with OLED / TFT displays.  
Supported screens:

* SSD1351 - This is the screen that's attached to the Pixel 2.0.

Wor in progress:

* SSD1331 - Screen that will be on the upcoming Pixel Mini
* ST7735 - Adafruit's 1.8" and 1.44" TFT screens.  I own the 1.44" ones, so I'll be implementing against them, soon as I can get around to soldering one up.
