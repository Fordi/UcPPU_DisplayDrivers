# Display drivers for μC PPU

This library provides backends for μC PPU to communicate with OLED / TFT displays.  
Supported screens:

* [SSD1351](https://www.newhavendisplay.com/app_notes/SSD1351.pdf) - This is the screen that's attached to the Pixel 2.0.

Wor in progress:

* [SSD1331](http://www.hpinfotech.ro/SSD1331.pdf) - Screen that (I assume) will be on the upcoming Pixel Mini
* [ST7735](http://www.displayfuture.com/Display/datasheet/controller/ST7735.pdf) - Adafruit's 1.8" and 1.44" TFT screens.  I own the 1.44" ones, so I'll be implementing against them, soon as I can get around to soldering one up.
